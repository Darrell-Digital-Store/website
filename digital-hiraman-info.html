                        We'll send you an account with the game that you want to play, then you'll set it as primary so you can play the game on your personal account. If you're interested, just message us so we can send you the full details and tutorial.

                        If your subscription is with trophies, you can play the game you rented from us on your personal account.

If your subscription is without trophies, you’ll play the game you rented from us on the account that we’ll provide. Also, you need a wifi connection.

                    <p>
                        Yes, you need to pay first if you're a new renter. Additionally, you need to pay an extra P200 for the assurance fee. However, the assurance fee is refundable at the end of your renting plan. We request an assurance fee from new customers to ensure that they will return the account after their renting plan
